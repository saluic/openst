Welcome! Here, we provide comprehensive resources to help you generate and analyse Open-ST data in your lab.
 
Open-ST is a spatial transcriptomics method that enables efficient whole-transcriptome capture at subcellular resolution. In [our paper](https://authors.elsevier.com/c/1jJckL7PXqR3U), we have demonstrated Open-ST's wide applicability, showing robust transcriptome capture across various mouse and human tissues. 
Our method is cost-efficient, straightforward to employ, and includes open-source software for seamless data processing and analysis.

Here, you can find detailed step-by-step descriptions of the experimental and the computational workflows. In a FAQ section we address commonly asked questions. Via our [discussion board] and our [chat], you can submit your own questions, and we will do our best to provide answers.
